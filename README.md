Questions:

1) 2 of the Routes code are almost identical, but because of the req, res, next, I coudn't put them on a unique function. Is there are way of doing that?

2) Is it possible to generate the map and don't go to the database again. How can we achieve that easily? Can we use a technique similar to the one we use with connect() ?
